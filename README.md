game_character_b

Often in video games there are multiple characters who have some kind of
interaction with each other. Often this is violent, but not always. The
caracters in a game can, for example, pass items between each other or have a
fight. In the program the character has hitpoints and items and the weapons
have an amount that causes damage to other character's hitpoints. If the
hitpoints go under zero, the character is destroyed.
